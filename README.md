## Matthew Brozen Lemon Light Coding Assignment
This is a create react app that demonstrates Matt's front end development ability with React

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, NPM, NPX, React, Firebase 

## Approach
By examining the instructions, the comp image and the conversation with Lucas I began by wanting to make a straight forward app that utilizes the common approaches and techniques in react. So in order to pass state from sibling components I decided to use a higher order component. By creating the routing function in the HOC and then passing it as props to the child nav component I am able to manipulate state while maintaining unidirectional data flow. Then based on the condition of the state I conditionally render the content.

## Future Work
In a role with Lemon Light I would further destructure the components in order to pass JSON that the component will consume and then iterate over to determine the conditions needed for the current navigation.
